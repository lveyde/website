I write my blog posts in Markdown format,  and then use the excellent [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site 
generator to generate HTML files. The topic of this blog post is how those HTML files are served
to you.

## Background

When you type in https://practicalgobook.net in your browser (or click it from somewhere), a translation,
commonly known as DNS resolution happens. As a result of this translation, the browser gets back
an IP address. This IP address refers to a virtual machine running in the cloud. I am running this
virtual machine on a Cloud provider.

When the browser's request reaches this virtual machine, a **program** then sends back the HTML files
that were generated by Hugo. This program is written using the Go programming language. 
I use the standard libraries and two third party packages for implementing advanced features. 

Let's dive in!

## Content delivery

The first working iteration of the server looked as follows:

```go
package main

import (
	"embed"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os"
)

//go:embed posts code
//go:embed index.html index.xml sitemap.xml
//go:embed categories css images
var siteData embed.FS

func main() {
	listenAddr := ":80"
	if len(os.Getenv("LISTEN_ADDR")) != 0 {
		listenAddr = os.Getenv("LISTEN_ADDR")

	}
	mux := http.NewServeMux()
	staticFileServer := http.FileServer(http.FS(siteData))
	mux.Handle("/", staticFileServer)

	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(listenAddr, mux))
}
```

The key standrad libraries here are:

- embed
- net/http
